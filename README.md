<p>I was introduced to technology at a young age through a computer at the public library. I frequented this library an hour a day, 6 days a week. Soon, I was far more adept than most adults and was surfing the web like a pro. Due to financial constraints, I was not able to pursue a profession in technology. 

Although unfortunate, the pandemic opened an opportunity for me to attend a Software Engineering bootcamp at Flatiron School. From here, I solidified my decision to pursue this career path and have been working on it since. There were days that I would forget to eat, nights that I would forget to sleep because I was having an amazing time coding.

I had a long road to get to this point but getting my foot in the door was another challenge in and of itself. I know I have what it takes to learn on the job and excel, however, the lack of a degree was stunting my chances. I decided to attend a local community college for an AAS in Computer Information Systems.

I am excited and eager to begin my journey in Software Engineering and will stop at nothing to pursue my passion.
